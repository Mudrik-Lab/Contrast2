Also, the authors reconcile this finding writing that using EEG the P3 could be recorded due to the same 200ms signal they have found with intracranial recordings but still consider this activation in fronto-parietal areas as low magnitude that is distinguished from the high magnitude gamma ignitions suggested by GNW\n (4) The ignition glow mentioned above, is suggested to convey content information and not causing the visibility of the percept. they refer to IIT but remain neutral", "Findings.NCC Tags [0 = Frontal, 1= Ventral Stream, 2 = V1, 3 = P300, 4= VAN, 5= Gamma, 6= Complexity, 7=Local Synchronization, 8= Global Synchronization, 9 = Fronto Parietal connectivity, 10 = Variability, 11 = A1, 12 = Dorsal Stream, 13 = Beta, 14 = Alpha, 15 = CNV, 16 = Parietal, 17 = DMN, 18 = Small Worldness, 19 = PHI Approximation, 20 = Metacognition, 21 = Posterior, 22 = N2pc, 23 = Recurrent Processing, 24 = GABA/NMDA, 25 = P2, 26 = MMN, 27 = N2, 28 = Theta, 29 = Delta , 30 = ART, 31 = V4, 32 = Early Components, 33 = Late Components, 34 = Temporal Parietal Connectivity, 35 = S1, 36 = N140, 37 = N170, 38 = Centrality, 39 = N1, 40 = CFC, 41 = Anterior Posterior Connectivity, 42 = Subcortical structures, 43 = Cortical Subcortical connectivity, 44 = Acetylcholine, 46 = SN, 47 = Motor areas connectivity, 48 = Temporal Occipital connectivity, 49 = Prestimulus Components, 50 = Low frequencies <1Hz, 51 = Uncinate Fasciculus, 53 = SPCN, 55 = Figure Ground Difference, 56 = Border Difference, 57 = P1, 58 = Frequency Increase,59 = Sleep Spindles,  60 = Slow Waves Activity, 62 = ERN, 63 = EPN, 64 = Hyper Synchronization, 65 = Plasticity, 66 = Anatomic Functional connectivity similarity,67 = Ultra slow fluctuations, 69 = M70, 70 = M130, 71 = ARN, 72 = M280, 74 = N400, 75 = Pe, 76 = Change related positivity, 77 = N150, 78 = Intermediate Components, 79 = SSVEP, 80 = inter lobe connectivity, 81 = Intrinsic Ignition, 82 = Ignition Variability, 83 = Hierarchical Structure, 84 = SCP, 85 = AAN, 86 = Dorsal Attention Network, 87 = Visual network]": "0 (IFG &) + -0(Frontal Cortex) + -16 (Parietal Cortex) + -3 (lack of P3 for non-targets) + 21 (Visual Areas) + 8 + -7 + 4 (200ms # BHF) + 4 (300ms# ERP)", "Findings.Measures [0 = Decoding, 1 = BOLD, 2 = Frequencies, 3= ERP, 4 = Mutual Information, 5 = Synchronization, 6 = Behavioral (Accuracy), 7 = Behavioral (RT), 9 = Connectivity, 10 = PHI, 11 = Graph theoretical measures, 14 = Entropy, 15 = Global Field Power, 16 = PCA, 17 = Lempel Ziv, 18 = H2_15O, 19 = Variability, 20 = Adaptation, 21 = Metacognition, 22 = Visibility, 25 = Dimension of activation, 26 = fALFF, 27 = 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose, 28 = CFC , 29 = LRTC, 30 = Calcium Imaging, 31 = K Complex, 32 = TCT, 33 = DISS, 34 = Observation, 35 = Microstates, 36 = Stimulation Reactivity, 37 = Frequency Tagging, 39 = Hopf bifurcation parameter, 41 = Slow Wave Activity, 42 = Auto Information Flow, 43 = Cross Information Flow ciF, 44 = Auto Correlation, 45 = Topo, 46 = PCI, 47 = Physiological Measure, 49 = Computer Simulations, 50 = Phosphene Threshold, 51 = Frequency Change Index, 52 = Brain Behavior Correlation, 56 = Nonlinear correlation index, 57 =DSI, 58 = Complexity of functional connectivity, 63 = BIS, 64 = Correlation dimension, 65 = Dominance, 66 = Epileptogenicity Index, 67 = Spike Suppression, 68 = Mean Dwell Time, 69 = Network Backbones, 70 = SSVEP, 71= Fractal Dimension]": "2 (Induced) + 3 (Peak)", "Encoding Notes": "(1) Large variability between patients in the behavioral task\n (2) Non targets do not result in motor responses but do include active maintenance in working memory\n (3) The authors related to the early components they found as related to the VAN component in the introduction.

Performance increased with the amount of evidence linearly in LV condition and reached 100% in HV high evidence conditions (high evidence means bigger difference in the amount of arrows pointing at certain direction). Nevertheless, only HV showed faster responses for higher evidence.\n  (2) behaviorally the final decision for LV and not HV was significantly dependent on the last arrow which suggest lower ability for strategic top down processes. Also, only for HV we see strategic weighting of arrows (less weight to the final arrow when the decision could already be made after the 4th one).\n (1) and (2) are considered to support GNW\n (3) confidence for LV was significantly lower than HV and did not correlate with correctness unlike in the HV condition. taken to support HOT in general sense\n (4) the last experiment confirmed that there is no significant different in priming due to bottom-up factors between HV and LV conditions.\n (5) Neural data suggest difference between HV and LV in frontal electrodes after 55ms (except for the first arrow which is similar to behavioral data suggesting lower weight for the first arrow in the decision), in parietal electrodes after 125ms and in occipital electrodes after 145ms. the fact the only after 145ms we see difference in the occipital areas is taken as evidence for feedforward sweep being intact between conditions yet feedback at latency of ~145ms is the crucial element for visibility.\n  The frontal difference after 55ms is taken as evidence for the role of frontal areas in the behavioral difference between HV and LV decision making. relating to the role of feedback and feedforward processes these results support RP and GNW\n  (6) when the first arrows produced stronger prior for the decision, weaker activity was found in right-occipito-parietal (250-300ms) and central electrodes (150-200ms) areas. \n  The inability to perform behaviorally strategic processes is in agreement with reduced parietal and frontal activity which suggest that the results favor an

A significant difference between occipital electrodes and frontal ones was observed only in masked words, while for unmasked ones there was no significant different between the lobes. The involvement of PFC is highlighted and in support of GNW.\n (2) the duration of effects in masked condition was much smaller than unmasked (60ms Vs 378ms)\n (3) the difference in effects between masked condition was apparent as early as 150ms after stimuli presentation, a time window suggested to be compatible with Lamme's feedforward sweep, yet the authors suggest that their findings regarding the recurrent loops as the first indication of consciousness are in disagreement with RPT due to their findings of correlates of consciousness only at much longer time periods than when recurrent loops occur.\n (4) Frequency analysis showed gamma band activity increase for masked words after 100-200ms from stimulus onset accompanied with beta reduction. in the 200-300ms time window masked words showed smaller gamma band increase and alpha reduction. in the 300-50ms window no further effects were found. \n  For unmasked words an even more pronounced gamma band increase and alpha and beta reduction was apparent in the 200-300ms time window. in the 300-500ms time window alpha reduction and high gamma band increase was found.\n  To summarize, masked words induced smaller changes in high gamma and beta bands, and the gamma band effects in masked words were all at posterior sites (occipital mainly).\n  (5) Phase synchrony analysis showed no significant phase coherence between electrodes for masked words, and significant phase coherence for unmasked words in the beta band (and not in the gamma band) taken as NCC and signal for global synchrony in support for GNW.(although they predicted phase synchrony in gamma band, they explain that beta band is more suitable for long distance connections which are suitable for GNW)\n  (6) Using granger causality measure - which suggests a causality above mere phase coherence (correlation) was found to in occipital areas at the time window of feedforward sweep for both masking conditions, yet a peak of causality for the mask (was seen for both masking conditions) and for unmasked words. in General and in accordance with GNW predictions granger causality gain was significantly greater for unmasked words starting from 200ms (no effect for 100-200 and the highest effect for 300-500ms window) and was observed for long distances. This is not taken as direct evidence for IIT but does refer to it in the introduction\n  (7) an unpredicted granger causality gain in the direction top down > bottom up was found for masked and not unmasked words. this is explained as attentional amplification for unsuccessful identification of unseen word.", "Findings.NCC Tags [0 = Frontal, 1= Ventral Stream, 2 = V1, 3 = P300, 4= VAN, 5= Gamma, 6= Complexity, 7=Local Synchronization, 8= Global Synchronization, 9 = Fronto Parietal connectivity, 10 = Variability, 11 = A1, 12 = Dorsal Stream, 13 = Beta, 14 = Alpha, 15 = CNV, 16 = Parietal, 17 = DMN, 18 = Small Worldness, 19 = PHI Approximation, 20 = Metacognition, 21 = Posterior, 22 = N2pc, 23 = Recurrent Processing, 24 = GABA/NMDA, 25 = P2, 26 = MMN, 27 = N2, 28 = Theta, 29 = Delta , 30 = ART, 31 = V4, 32 = Early Components, 33 = Late Components, 34 = Temporal Parietal Connectivity, 35 = S1, 36 = N140, 37 = N170, 38 = Centrality, 39 = N1, 40 = CFC, 41 = Anterior Posterior Connectivity, 42 = Subcortical structures, 43 = Cortical Subcortical connectivity, 44 = Acetylcholine, 46 = SN, 47 = Motor areas connectivity, 48 = Temporal Occipital connectivity, 49 = Prestimulus Components, 50 = Low frequencies <1Hz, 51 = Uncinate Fasciculus, 53 = SPCN, 55 = Figure Ground Difference, 56 = Border Difference, 57 = P1, 58 = Frequency Increase,59 = Sleep Spindles,  60 = Slow Waves Activity, 62 = ERN, 63 = EPN, 64 = Hyper Synchronization, 65 = Plasticity, 66 = Anatomic Functional connectivity similarity,67 = Ultra slow fluctuations, 69 = M70, 70 = M130, 71 = ARN, 72 = M280, 74 = N400, 75 = Pe, 76 = Change related positivity, 77 = N150, 78 = Intermediate Components, 79 = SSVEP, 80 = inter lobe connectivity, 81 = Intrinsic Ignition, 82 = Ignition Variability, 83 = Hierarchical Structure, 84 = SCP, 85 = AAN, 86 = Dorsal Attention Network, 87 = Visual network]": "0 (Frontal Cortex &) + -5(Power 30-50Hz <100-200ms> # at posterior occipital and temporal electrodes) + 5 (Power 30-50Hz <300-500ms># in frontal electrodes) + 8 (#the precent of electrodes showing increased activity following masked presentations was lower compared with unmasked ones, also the activity was generally more constrained to posterior areas in the masked condition and increased connectivity between long range distances specific to unmasked presentations) + -21 (Occipital cortex & Fusiform Cortex &) + 13 (Connectivity 13-30Hz# coupling between long distance areas only in the unmasked condition in the beta band and beta band activity suppression for visible condition) + 41 (Granger Causality connectivity for occipital to frontal areas was absent in masked presentations in the time window of >200ms) + 14 (Power Neg 8-13Hz <300-500ms>) + 13 (Power Neg 13-30Hz <300-500ms>)", "Findings.Measures [0 = Decoding, 1 = BOLD, 2 = Frequencies, 3= ERP, 4 = Mutual Information, 5 = Synchronization, 6 = Behavioral (Accuracy), 7 = Behavioral (RT), 9 = Connectivity, 10 = PHI, 11 = Graph theoretical measures, 14 = Entropy, 15 = Global Field Power, 16 = PCA, 17 = Lempel Ziv, 18 = H2_15O, 19 = Variability, 20 = Adaptation, 21 = Metacognition, 22 = Visibility, 25 = Dimension of activation, 26 = fALFF, 27 = 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose, 28 = CFC , 29 = LRTC, 30 = Calcium Imaging, 31 = K Complex, 32 = TCT, 33 = DISS, 34 = Observation, 35 = Microstates, 36 = Stimulation Reactivity, 37 = Frequency Tagging, 39 = Hopf bifurcation parameter, 41 = Slow Wave Activity, 42 = Auto Information Flow, 43 = Cross Information Flow ciF, 44 = Auto Correlation, 45 = Topo, 46 = PCI, 47 = Physiological Measure, 49 = Computer Simulations, 50 = Phosphene Threshold, 51 = Frequency Change Index, 52 = Brain Behavior Correlation, 56 = Nonlinear correlation index, 57 =DSI, 58 = Complexity of functional connectivity, 63 = BIS, 64 = Correlation dimension, 65 = Dominance, 66 = Epileptogenicity Index, 67 = Spike Suppression, 68 = Mean Dwell Time, 69 = Network Backbones, 70 = SSVEP, 71= Fractal Dimension]": "3 (Cluster) + 9 (functional connectivity, phase synchrony) + 9 (effective connectivity, Granger Causality) + 2 (Induced & Evoked -

PAS 4 showed similar brain areas but with more widespread activity.\n  (3) contrast between the two tasks and between PAS 1 to catch trials did not result in any significant difference at the whole brain level .\n  From (2) and (3) the authors conclude that a widespread fronto-parietal network is being activated for \"seen\" targets but due to the fact that activity in these regions is the strongest for intermediate visibility levels it is considered to reflect attentional rather than visibility related processes, which is taken against GNW, moreover it seems like the activity in the posterior areas is the one that differentiate between \"not seen\" to seen stimuli which is also against GNW.\n  \n  The lack of difference between the two tasks at the whole brain level constraints the conclusions but still the authors consider the occipital activity in low level task which didn't appear for high level task indicates a differential processing for the two tasks.\n  (4) ROI analysis (of NCC areas) didn't find difference between the two tasks.", "Findings.NCC Tags [0 = Frontal, 1= Ventral Stream, 2 = V1, 3 = P300, 4= VAN, 5= Gamma, 6= Complexity, 7=Local Synchronization, 8= Global Synchronization, 9 = Fronto Parietal connectivity, 10 = Variability, 11 = A1, 12 = Dorsal Stream, 13 = Beta, 14 = Alpha, 15 = CNV, 16 = Parietal, 17 = DMN, 18 = Small Worldness, 19 = PHI Approximation, 20 = Metacognition, 21 = Posterior, 22 = N2pc, 23 = Recurrent Processing, 24 = GABA/NMDA, 25 = P2, 26 = MMN, 27 = N2, 28 = Theta, 29 = Delta , 30 = ART, 31 = V4, 32 = Early Components, 33 = Late Components, 34 = Temporal Parietal Connectivity, 35 = S1, 36 = N140, 37 = N170, 38 = Centrality, 39 = N1, 40 = CFC, 41 = Anterior Posterior Connectivity, 42 = Subcortical structures, 43 = Cortical Subcortical connectivity, 44 = Acetylcholine, 46 = SN, 47 = Motor areas connectivity, 48 = Temporal Occipital connectivity, 49 = Prestimulus Components, 50 = Low frequencies <1Hz, 51 = Uncinate Fasciculus, 53 = SPCN, 55 = Figure Ground Difference, 56 = Border Difference, 57 = P1, 58 = Frequency Increase,59 = Sleep Spindles,  60 = Slow Waves Activity, 62 = ERN, 63 = EPN, 64 = Hyper Synchronization, 65 = Plasticity, 66 = Anatomic Functional connectivity similarity,67 = Ultra slow fluctuations, 69 = M70, 70 = M130, 71 = ARN, 72 = M280, 74 = N400, 75 = Pe, 76 = Change related positivity, 77 = N150, 78 = Intermediate Components, 79 = SSVEP, 80 = inter lobe connectivity, 81 = Intrinsic Ignition, 82 = Ignition Variability, 83 = Hierarchical Structure, 84 = SCP, 85 = AAN, 86 = Dorsal Attention Network, 87 = Visual network]": "0 (precentral gyrus) + 16 (superior parietal lobule & postcentral gyrus) + 42 (paracingulate gyrus)", "Findings.Measures [0 = Decoding, 1 = BOLD, 2 = Frequencies, 3= ERP, 4 = Mutual Information, 5 = Synchronization, 6 = Behavioral (Accuracy), 7 = Behavioral (RT), 9 = Connectivity, 10 = PHI, 11 = Graph theoretical measures, 14 = Entropy, 15 = Global Field Power, 16 = PCA, 17 = Lempel Ziv, 18 = H2_15O, 19 = Variability, 20 = Adaptation, 21 = Metacognition, 22 = Visibility, 25 = Dimension of activation, 26 = fALFF, 27 = 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose, 28 = CFC , 29 = LRTC, 30 = Calcium Imaging, 31 = K Complex, 32 = TCT, 33 = DISS, 34 = Observation, 35 = Microstates, 36 = Stimulation Reactivity, 37 = Frequency Tagging, 39 = Hopf bifurcation parameter, 41 = Slow Wave Activity, 42 = Auto Information Flow, 43 = Cross Information Flow ciF, 44 = Auto Correlation, 45 = Topo, 46 = PCI, 47 = Physiological Measure, 49 = Computer Simulations, 50 = Phosphene Threshold, 51 = Frequency Change Index, 52 = Brain Behavior Correlation, 56 = Nonlinear correlation index, 57 =DSI, 58 = Complexity of functional connectivity, 63 = BIS, 64 = Correlation dimension, 65 = Dominance, 66 = Epileptogenicity Index, 67 = Spike Suppression, 68 = Mean Dwell Time, 69 = Network Backbones, 70 = SSVEP, 71= Fractal Dimension]": 1, "Encoding Notes": "Note that the report was given after a considerable delay from target presentation (2247ms -

The fact that N170 was not present for the IB group is taken to point at lack of top-down attention to the stimuli which causes local recurrent processing - which according to other studies suggest that it is a necessary but insufficient ingredient for conscious processing (other studies found unconscious N170 for faces).\n (4) VAN (265-305ms) differentiated between the two groups at Phase1. In phase 2 and 3 it did not and phase was correlated positively with VAN amplitude.\n (5) SN (selection negativity - 375-415ms) was only significant for noticers group at phase 3 and approached significance for IB group at Phase 3.\n (6) P3b (400-600ms) showed no main effect of group, P3b was only significant at Phase 3, and for both of the groups. This is taken as evidence against P3b as NCC since the face stimuli were perceived consciously already at Phase 2 for both groups.", "Findings.NCC Tags [0 = Frontal, 1= Ventral Stream, 2 = V1, 3 = P300, 4= VAN, 5= Gamma, 6= Complexity, 7=Local Synchronization, 8= Global Synchronization, 9 = Fronto Parietal connectivity, 10 = Variability, 11 = A1, 12 = Dorsal Stream, 13 = Beta, 14 = Alpha, 15 = CNV, 16 = Parietal, 17 = DMN, 18 = Small Worldness, 19 = PHI Approximation, 20 = Metacognition, 21 = Posterior, 22 = N2pc, 23 = Recurrent Processing, 24 = GABA/NMDA, 25 = P2, 26 = MMN, 27 = N2, 28 = Theta, 29 = Delta , 30 = ART, 31 = V4, 32 = Early Components, 33 = Late Components, 34 = Temporal Parietal Connectivity, 35 = S1, 36 = N140, 37 = N170, 38 = Centrality, 39 = N1, 40 = CFC, 41 = Anterior Posterior Connectivity, 42 = Subcortical structures, 43 = Cortical Subcortical connectivity, 44 = Acetylcholine, 46 = SN, 47 = Motor areas connectivity, 48 = Temporal Occipital connectivity, 49 = Prestimulus Components, 50 = Low frequencies <1Hz, 51 = Uncinate Fasciculus, 53 = SPCN, 55 = Figure Ground Difference, 56 = Border Difference, 57 = P1, 58 = Frequency Increase,59 = Sleep Spindles,  60 = Slow Waves Activity, 62 = ERN, 63 = EPN, 64 = Hyper Synchronization, 65 = Plasticity, 66 = Anatomic Functional connectivity similarity,67 = Ultra slow fluctuations, 69 = M70, 70 = M130, 71 = ARN, 72 = M280, 74 = N400, 75 = Pe, 76 = Change related positivity, 77 = N150, 78 = Intermediate Components, 79 = SSVEP, 80 = inter lobe connectivity, 81 = Intrinsic Ignition, 82 = Ignition Variability, 83 = Hierarchical Structure, 84 = SCP, 85 = AAN, 86 = Dorsal Attention Network, 87 = Visual network]": "4 (265-305ms) + 37 (180-220ms) + -3(400-600ms) + -16 (Pz electrode# for P3b)+ 16 (PO8 electrode# for VAN) + 21 + -46 (375-415ms)", "Findings.Measures [0 = Decoding, 1 = BOLD, 2 = Frequencies, 3= ERP, 4 = Mutual Information, 5 = Synchronization, 6 = Behavioral (Accuracy), 7 = Behavioral (RT), 9 = Connectivity, 10 = PHI, 11 = Graph theoretical measures, 14 = Entropy, 15 = Global Field Power, 16 = PCA, 17 = Lempel Ziv, 18 = H2_15O, 19 = Variability, 20 = Adaptation, 21 = Metacognition, 22 = Visibility, 25 = Dimension of activation, 26 = fALFF, 27 = 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose, 28 = CFC , 29 = LRTC, 30 = Calcium Imaging, 31 = K Complex, 32 = TCT, 33 = DISS, 34 = Observation, 35 = Microstates, 36 = Stimulation Reactivity, 37 = Frequency Tagging, 39 = Hopf bifurcation parameter, 41 = Slow Wave Activity, 42 = Auto Information Flow, 43 = Cross Information Flow ciF, 44 = Auto Correlation, 45 = Topo, 46 = PCI, 47 = Physiological Measure, 49 = Computer Simulations, 50 = Phosphene Threshold, 51 = Frequency Change Index, 52 = Brain Behavior Correlation, 56 = Nonlinear correlation index, 57 =DSI, 58 = Complexity of functional connectivity, 63 = BIS, 64 = Correlation dimension, 65 = Dominance, 66 = Epileptogenicity Index, 67 = Spike Suppression, 68 = Mean Dwell Time, 69 = Network Backbones, 70 = SSVEP, 71= Fractal Dimension]": "3 (Mean Amplitudes)", "Encoding Notes": null, "Interpretation.GNW[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": 0, "Interpretation.IIT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": 1, "Interpretation.RPT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": "X", "Interpretation.HOT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": "X", "Affiliation": "X", "Theory Driven [0 = No, 1=Mentioning, 2 = Theory Driven]": "2 (GNW)", "Internal Replication [0 = Not, 1=Internal Replication]": 0.0, "Findings.Spatial AAL Mapping": null}, {"Paper.Title": "Neural basis of non-conscious visual working memory", "Paper.DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.01.016", "# Exp": 1, "Experimental paradigms.Main Paradigm": "Masking + Stimulus Degradation", "Experimental paradigms.Specific Paradigm": "Backward Masking (Masking) + Intensity Reduction (Stimulus Degradation)", "Experimental paradigms.Report [0 = No-Report, 1 = Report, 2 = Report And No-Report]": 1, "Sample.Type [0 = Healthy Adults, 1 = Healthy College Students, 2 = Children, 3 = Patients, 5 = Non-human, 6 = Computer]": 0, "Sample.Total": 24, "Sample.Included": 24, "Task.Description": "Participants reported whether the target stimulus was oriented to the left/right compared to the cue stimuli.

This is taken to suggest that in the two groups similar amount of information was available in the neural recordings of both groups although only wan group has conscious access of this information.\n  (4) V1 and V2 showed heightened activity for the Kanizsa illusion although their receptive field is 6-12 smaller that the size needed to perceive the Kanizsa figure. This is taken to suggest that recurrent processing is the cause of this heightened activity and what caused the perception of the Kanizsa.\n  \n  The results are taken to indicate that although no

In addition the second parameter of the model - Global Coupling showed higher values for the awake state. This was taken as possibly compatible with GNW yet no localization of the cause of these effect to fronto-parietal areas was available in this analysis.\n (5) Effective connectivity estimated according to the anatomical and functional connections between brain areas was shown to be lower for sleep states. The nodes showing the highest differences in EC between states (with higher EC for awake state) were STG,Precentral gyrus, Postcentral gyrus, Putamen, Insula, IFG pars opercularis, Middle occipital gyrus and Inferior occipital cortex .Yet the few regions showing higher EC during sleep were the V1, cuneus, lingual gyrus (right) and the paracentral lobule.\n  \n The results are interpreted as

Particular this pattern was observed in primary\n  sensory and association cortices with the more robust reduction of\n  functional connectivity in SWS in occipital, temporal, and parietal cortices than in prefrontal cortices. \n  (3) In general, functional connectivity was highest in light sleep and lowest in slow-wave sleep, with wakefulness taking an intermediate position. There was also a significant effect of sleep on local clustering values, which were highest in SWS and lowest in light sleep when compared with values of random networks. although a small-world topology was present in all stages.", "Findings.NCC Tags [0 = Frontal, 1= Ventral Stream, 2 = V1, 3 = P300, 4= VAN, 5= Gamma, 6= Complexity, 7=Local Synchronization, 8= Global Synchronization, 9 = Fronto Parietal connectivity, 10 = Variability, 11 = A1, 12 = Dorsal Stream, 13 = Beta, 14 = Alpha, 15 = CNV, 16 = Parietal, 17 = DMN, 18 = Small Worldness, 19 = PHI Approximation, 20 = Metacognition, 21 = Posterior, 22 = N2pc, 23 = Recurrent Processing, 24 = GABA/NMDA, 25 = P2, 26 = MMN, 27 = N2, 28 = Theta, 29 = Delta , 30 = ART, 31 = V4, 32 = Early Components, 33 = Late Components, 34 = Temporal Parietal Connectivity, 35 = S1, 36 = N140, 37 = N170, 38 = Centrality, 39 = N1, 40 = CFC, 41 = Anterior Posterior Connectivity, 42 = Subcortical structures, 43 = Cortical Subcortical connectivity, 44 = Acetylcholine, 46 = SN, 47 = Motor areas connectivity, 48 = Temporal Occipital connectivity, 49 = Prestimulus Components, 50 = Low frequencies <1Hz, 51 = Uncinate Fasciculus, 53 = SPCN, 55 = Figure Ground Difference, 56 = Border Difference, 57 = P1, 58 = Frequency Increase,59 = Sleep Spindles,  60 = Slow Waves Activity, 62 = ERN, 63 = EPN, 64 = Hyper Synchronization, 65 = Plasticity, 66 = Anatomic Functional connectivity similarity,67 = Ultra slow fluctuations, 69 = M70, 70 = M130, 71 = ARN, 72 = M280, 74 = N400, 75 = Pe, 76 = Change related positivity, 77 = N150, 78 = Intermediate Components, 79 = SSVEP, 80 = inter lobe connectivity, 81 = Intrinsic Ignition, 82 = Ignition Variability, 83 = Hierarchical Structure, 84 = SCP, 85 = AAN, 86 = Dorsal Attention Network, 87 = Visual network]": "8 (<fMRI>) + -7 (high clustering coefficient in deep sleep <fMRI>) + 18 (<fMRI>) + 41 (<fMRI>#sensory to association cortex connections while association cortex includes fronto-parietal areas) + 43 (<fMRI> # thalamocortical connectivity was reduces in sleep states)", "Findings.Measures [0 = Decoding, 1 = BOLD, 2 = Frequencies, 3= ERP, 4 = Mutual Information, 5 = Synchronization, 6 = Behavioral (Accuracy), 7 = Behavioral (RT), 9 = Connectivity, 10 = PHI, 11 = Graph theoretical measures, 14 = Entropy, 15 = Global Field Power, 16 = PCA, 17 = Lempel Ziv, 18 = H2_15O, 19 = Variability, 20 = Adaptation, 21 = Metacognition, 22 = Visibility, 25 = Dimension of activation, 26 = fALFF, 27 = 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose, 28 = CFC , 29 = LRTC, 30 = Calcium Imaging, 31 = K Complex, 32 = TCT, 33 = DISS, 34 = Observation, 35 = Microstates, 36 = Stimulation Reactivity, 37 = Frequency Tagging, 39 = Hopf bifurcation parameter, 41 = Slow Wave Activity, 42 = Auto Information Flow, 43 = Cross Information Flow ciF, 44 = Auto Correlation, 45 = Topo, 46 = PCI, 47 = Physiological Measure, 49 = Computer Simulations, 50 = Phosphene Threshold, 51 = Frequency Change Index, 52 = Brain Behavior Correlation, 56 = Nonlinear correlation index, 57 =DSI, 58 = Complexity of functional connectivity, 63 = BIS, 64 = Correlation dimension, 65 = Dominance, 66 = Epileptogenicity Index, 67 = Spike Suppression, 68 = Mean Dwell Time, 69 = Network Backbones, 70 = SSVEP, 71= Fractal Dimension]": "9 (functional connectivity) + 11 (average path length & small-worldness & clustering) + 1", "Encoding Notes": null, "Interpretation.GNW[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": "X", "Interpretation.IIT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": 1, "Interpretation.RPT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": "X", "Interpretation.HOT[0=Against, 1=Confirm, X=Neutral]": "X", "Affiliation": "X", "Theory Driven [0 = No, 1=Mentioning, 2 = Theory Driven]": "2 (IIT)", "Internal Replication [0 = Not, 1=Internal Replication]": 0.0, "Findings.Spatial AAL Mapping": null}, {"Paper.Title": "Cortical reactivity and effective connectivity during REM sleep in humans", "Paper.DOI": "10.1080/17588921003731578", "# Exp": 1, "Experimental paradigms.Main Paradigm": "Sleep + Direct Stimulation", "Experimental paradigms.Specific Paradigm": "TMS (Direct Stimulation, PMC)", "Experimental paradigms.Report [0 = No-Report, 1 = Report, 2 = Report And No-Report]": 0, "Sample.Type [0 = Healthy Adults, 1 = Healthy College Students, 2 = Children, 3 = Patients, 5 = Non-human, 6 = Computer]": 0, "Sample.Total": 10, "Sample.Included": 5, "Task.Description": "none", "Task.Code [0 = No Task, 1 = Discrimination, 2 = Detection, 3= Go/No-Go, 4 = Deviant Detection, 5 = Stimulus Judgement, 7 = Memory, 8 = Change Detection, 9 = Counting task, 10 = Delayed Task, 14 = Task Switching, 17 = N-Back, 18 = Dual Task, 19 = Awareness Report, 21 = Confidence Report, 22 = Binocular Rivalry Task, 23 = Visual Search, 24 = Identification, 26 = NA, 27 = Driving, 30 = Imagination, 32 = Task Switching, 33 = Mental Rotation, 35 = Color Matching, 36 = Mood, 37 = Mathematics]": 0, "Should be included?

Two networks correlated with the subjective response of vividness of re-experiencing the memory event : vPCC/RSc, lrPHG, lrOCG, network II : comprised the rIFG, rAG, lrSMG, and dPCC. Two areas (rITG and lPCu) were included in both networks. Compared to the non-instructed rest condition, both networks displayed strong increases in connectivity amidst their respective regions, while remaining uncorrelated to each other and to the areas identified in the math condition.\n (2) The EEG session results : microstate analysis was done be using K-means classification to clusters and then relabeling time points in the EEG measures to each meta state. Two states (C and D) were found were modulated by memory condition compared with math with only C was associated with memory condition, and another state (B) differed between these condition and rest. Source localization of microstates showed that Microstate B showed main activity in OCG and in the medial part of the parietal cortex in the PCu/RSc.
